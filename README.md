# SchedulingAlgorithms
A symulation of different scheduling algorithms in operating system. Approximation of how efficiently access to CPU is managed by the following:
- FCFS - first come first served
- SJFnp - shortest job first, non-preemptive
- SJFp - shortest job first, preemptive
- RR - round rabin

The mockup is of course very basic and does not consider wait time for switching between contexts or deleting processes, etc. This simulation only considers a single-threaded processing unit, and so, is a gross simplification of any real system.
